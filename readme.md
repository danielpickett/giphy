#Overview

This project is a clone of the Giphy website using Giphy's own API to enable search of gifs from their database. I did this project because we started using Slack at work and the Giphy integration for Slack is terrrible. Previously, we used Stride by Atlassian which had a pretty decent Giphy integration that showed a side panel with Giphy search and displayed a scrollable panel of results. Slack just shows one gif at a time and has a "shuffle" button to show the next gif if you don't like the first one. I tried using the Giphy website, but that didn't allow me to drag gifs from Chrome onto my desktop. Instead, dragging gifs from giphy.com just saved a url link. So I made this app to return actual gif files that can be dragged to the desktop and then onto Slack.
